# todolist-ios

The app uses both Pods and Carthage dependencies. Ideally you can just checkout the master branch and setup both carthage and Pods to run the app.

If you run into any issues while doing so, you can checkout the `direct-run` branch which has Pods and Carthage pushed. You should be able to run the app without any further setup through that.
